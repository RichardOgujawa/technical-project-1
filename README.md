Accompanying the increase of the number of vehicles on the road (Nealon, 2023), came an increase in the number of road fatalities. According to a statement by Statement by Jonathan Adkins, CEO of Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA): "Traffic deaths have surged 30\% over the past decade, with nearly 10,000 more fatalities when compared to 32,893 in 2013." Innovations are being made towards mitigating this, such as smart systems and head-up displays in cars, however the issue persists. The goal of this project was to contribute to the concerted efforts made towards making the roads safer.

The primary objectives of this project was to produce a Machine Learning (ML) model that would be able to make predictions regarding the likelihood of a severe crash given a set of parameters like time, date and location, to help caution drivers and encourage safer driving.
